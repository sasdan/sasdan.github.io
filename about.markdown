Saskia Kroonenberg [teaches](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/kroonenberg-s) at the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures of the Radboud University. Besides teaching, she investigates how languages, bodies, and the earth interrelate, by means of dance, poetry, and [a PhD](https://artes.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/41302.html) at the University of Cologne. She was also a guest researcher at the [Institute for Cultural Inquiry (ICON)](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-cultural-inquiry) at Utrecht University and at the [Romanisches Seminar](https://www.rose.uzh.ch/de.html) of the University of Zurich. Her doctoral research aimed to redefine the notion of a ‘mother tongue’ in a globalizing world, as a non-unitary relation between bodies, languages, and earth. Her fields of interest are Italian literature, gender and postcolonial studies, and new materialism.
