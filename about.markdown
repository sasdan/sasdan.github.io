Saskia Kroonenberg investigates how languages and bodies interrelate in a highly medialized and globalizing world. She does so by means of dance, poetry, and by writing a doctoral thesis which combines Italian literature, historical linguistics, and philosophy. 

Saskia is a [Marie-Curie Doctoral Fellow at the a.r.t.e.s. Graduate School for the Humanities](https://artes.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/forschung/dissertationsprojekte-im-integrated-track/profilseiten-it/kroonenberg-saskia) in Cologne and an affiliated researcher at the [Institute for Cultural Inquiry (ICON)](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-cultural-inquiry) at Utrecht University. Her research aims to redefine the notion of a ‘mother tongue’ in a globalizing world, as a non-unitary relation between bodies, languages, and earth.
