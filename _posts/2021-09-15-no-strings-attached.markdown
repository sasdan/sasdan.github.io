"No strings attached? Finding new ways of communicating" is a multimedia reflection on bodily movement after progress based on poetry, science, and dance. It asks what acceleration/slowing down of a body is and how movement relates to time and space. "No strings attached?" will be part of Goldsmiths' (London) virtual exhibition called After Progress, which is to be opened soon.

With Movementalist (Dayna Martinez Morales and Vincent Verburg) and Natalia Helena Salloum
