My new article [Gramsci's Writing Body. On Embodiment and Subaltern Knowledge](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369801X.2023.2191861) explores how Gramsci’s own lived experience may have contributed to his subaltern philosophy. Its focus is especially on his disabled body (embodiedness) and relational needs, arguing that these aspects deserve a central role in his intellectual legacy. Including a Deleuzian perspective, it aims to correct for the neglect of Gramsci’s own needs and affects and the gendered support system on which he relied in prison, especially highlighting the role of his sister-in-law, Tatiana Schucht.
